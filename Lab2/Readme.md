# Lab 2: Asset Inventories and Sitemaps

## Website Analyzed
The website I am documenting is: [MK Hair Studio](https://mkhairstudio.ca/)

## Contents
- **Asset Inventory**: Excel sheets documenting all text, images, and media assets currently on the website.
- **Sitemap**: Visual representation of the website structure, showing the relationship between pages.
- **Lab Document**: ENSE 271 Lab 2.pdf for lab reference.

## Description
This lab focuses on information architecture and content auditing. The tasks include:
- Building a hierarchical sitemap to map user navigation.
- Collecting and categorizing assets (text, images, UI elements).
- Applying UX principles for better site structure and user experience.

## Notes
- Sitemap follows a flat hierarchy with `Home`, `About`, `Services`, `Portfolio`, and `Contact` pages.
- The asset inventory spreadsheets track text content, images, and other assets per page.
