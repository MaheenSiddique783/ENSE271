# Lab 4: Hi-Fi Prototypes with Figma

## Overview
In this lab, the focus was on creating **interactive prototypes** using Figma's prototyping mode. This involved connecting wireframes, adding animations, and simulating navigation within a mobile application concept. I made a virtual tour of Dhaka,Bangladesh, where visitors to the site can learn about 3 landmarks in and around Dhaka. 

## Project Description
I made a virtual tour of Dhaka,Bangladesh, where visitors to the site can learn about 3 landmarks in and around Dhaka. The prototype includes: 
- A Home Page
- A working menu to access all pages
- Three landmark pages, each showcasing a location with:
    - Images and text descriptions
     - Interactions such as carousels, smart animate transitions, and draggable galleries.

## Files Included
- **Prototype File**: `Lab4 ENSE271 (1).fig` – contains all prototype pages and animations.
- **Lab Document**: `ENSE 271 Lab 4.pdf` – lab instructions provided for context.

## Notes
- All landmark pages feature different interaction types.
- A **Smart Animate** effect is used on one of the landmark pages and is labeled inside the Figma file as requested.
