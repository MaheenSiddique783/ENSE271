# Lab 4: Hi-Fi Prototypes with Figma

## Overview
In this lab, the focus was on creating **interactive prototypes** using Figma's prototyping mode. This involved connecting wireframes, adding animations, and simulating navigation within a mobile application concept.

## Project Description
I created a **virtual tour** prototype for a fictional (or real-world) location. The interactive prototype includes:
- A Home Page
- A working menu to access all pages
- Three landmark pages, each showcasing a location with:
    - Images and text descriptions
    - Unique interactions such as carousels, smart animate transitions, and draggable galleries.

## Files Included
- **Prototype File**: `Lab4 ENSE271 (1).fig` – contains all prototype pages and animations.
- **Lab Document**: `ENSE 271 Lab 4.pdf` – lab instructions provided for context.

## Notes
- All landmark pages feature different interaction types.
- A **Smart Animate** effect is used on one of the landmark pages and is labeled inside the Figma file as requested.
